### Hi there, I'm Jean 👋 👨‍💻.

I'm a junior web developer currently improving my coding skills at the 10-months [BeCode webdev training](https://becode.org/learn/junior-web-developer/) in Brussels (Belgium).

My current strengths are JS/React & Node.js/Express.js, and I also have experience with PHP/Laravel.

I'm also passionate about three.js and love to learn new things every day in a general fashion 🤘.
